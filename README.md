# Data-Analysis-Michelin

**Context**

Paris has the greatest concentration of Michelin restaurants in France. But what other cities in  France  also offer impeccable cuisine?

In this case study we'll discover what cities outside Paris offer  world-class restaurants in a smaller context. In a post-2020 COVID-scared world, many people will look to mid-sized cities to vacation and eat great food. 

We will consider the 15 largest cities in France to see the availability of Michelin resturants and the value of local Airbnb properties.

**Analysis**

I used webscrapper.io to collect data on Airbnb properties in France and Michelin Guide restaurants across the country.

Next, I completed standard data wrangling and consistency checks.

I ran linear regression models to test variables. 

Finally, I used cluster analysis in python to uncover more patterns.
